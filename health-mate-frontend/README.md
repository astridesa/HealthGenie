This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
如果命令行没有装npm或yarn或pnpm,直接问chatgpt比较方便

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

My child is a picky eater, especially disliking broccoli and cabbage. Do you have any cruciferous vegetable recipes that might make children more willing to eat them?

I have gout, and my doctor wants me to control my purine intake. I would like to ask whether cruciferous vegetables can trigger gout attacks. Which ones can be eaten in moderation, and which ones should be avoided?

I’ve been looking to boost my immune system. Which cruciferous vegetables are higher in vitamin C, and how should I cook them to retain more of it?
